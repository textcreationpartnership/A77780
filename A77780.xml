         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Antichriſts Transformations within, Diſcovered by The LIGHT
within.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <p>THis is given forth to all Friends and Brethren who look upon
themſelves to be Elders and Teachers of others, who think that they have both
a right and a power to be Judges in the Churches called Quakers, in matters of
Religion, Principles, and Practiſes; which thing only belongs to God, in the
Worſhip of God in matters of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Friends, I do deny that man hath any Rule, Power, Dominion,
Government, or Authority, either given or committed unto him from the Lord, as
pertaining to the Conſcience in things relating to the worſhip of God; for
all Power in Heaven and Earth, Rule, Authority, and Dominion, belongeth unto
Chriſt the Light, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible power which dwells in all Men and Women as
pertaining to the Conſcience; and all Glory and Honour, Praiſe and
Thanksgiving is to be given by man to Chriſt the Light which is in them,
becauſe he is the only Redeemer, and the Saviour of the Souls, and the
Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ends of the Earth; and ſo there is no glory to be given to
man, although he be born of the Light; but all is to be given to Chriſt the
Light in Man, unto whom alone it doth belong, who is the true Miniſter, and
hath power in himſelf to teach all the Sons and Daughters of men, who hear
his voice and obey him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whoſoever doth exalt Chriſt the Light,
who is the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, before themſelves, by Chriſt the Light within
ſhall thoſe be exalted, otherwiſe, by the Light within they muſt be
overturned; for it never was Antechriſt in the heart nor yet Antechriſt in
thoſe which meet together to wait upon God in true ſilence, the which
brought in falſe Doctrine, Errour, and Hereſie among us Quakers, or other
Sects whatſoever; but it was Antechriſt in the Prieſts and falſe
Prophets, which was the inſtrumental cauſe by the which the <hi>Jews</hi>
of old were lead into Errour; and it was Antechriſt in thoſe heaps of
Teachers, that lead the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into errour 

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172147:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> days, and ſo read
down from the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> days to this day, ever ſince the night
of Apoſtacy came over the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and it hath been
Antichriſt in and among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Teachers, the which hath had
dominion over all, both great and ſmall, who have given their power to the
Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Friends, This is my Judgement, Faith, and Belief, that
whatſoever is written to the Churches called Quakers, by either Man or Men,
Elders or Bodies by way of Exhortation, Advice, or Counſel, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
or by way of dehortation, or for warning them of Evil in matters of
Conſcience, which thing belongs to God, it ought to be written to the
Churches, both in, and by, and from the Holy Ghoſt, which is Gods infallible
Spirit, and the word of Eternal Life, and alſo the Spirit of Revelation, yea
and all Declarations, all Preachings and Prayings in the Churches called
Quakers whereſoever, it is the Holy Ghoſt which is to ſpeak in every
Veſſel; ſo that no Man or Woman is either to Pray or Preach, or cauſe
any thing to be Printed and ſent among the Churches, but what comes in and
from the Holy Ghoſt, otherwiſe it is not to be owned by the Churches, for
<hi>Moſes</hi> he received the Law from the mouth of God, before he delivered
it to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> he wrote his
Epiſtles to the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in, and by, and from the
Spirit of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and <hi>John</hi> he was in the Spirit of the Lord when
he wrote to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Wherefore your Paper to
the Churches, it is not to be own'd by the Churches, in as much as it was
written from a ſight, or a ſence, and from the ſenceable part, and not in
and from the Spirit of Revelation: now whatſoever is written declared, or
given forth in the ſight, or in the ſence, or from the ſenſible part,
it is not to be owned, for the ſenceable part is that which hath been in the
tranſgreſſion with the woman, with all her ſights and ſenſes, in
every viſible man, and this is ſhe which feeds upon the fruit the which the
tree of knowledge bears; for things being opened to her in the underſtanding,
by the Spirit of Truth, ſhe having received the ſights and the openings,
Antichriſt being near, the mind not being kept in the Watch, his work is, to
draw the mind from him which openeth, into the myſteries which are recorded
in the Book of the Scriptures, which myſteries are opened to the Woman by the
Spirit of Truth, and thus Antichriſt has cheated thouſands; for the Woman
is the ſole mind or heart in every viſible Man and Woman, which is
accompanied with an underſtanding part, and a knowing part, and a
ſenſible part, and an affectionate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172147:2"/>
part, and a
comprehending part; for it has been the work of that old Adverſary which is
called the Devil, in ages paſt to ſteal the mind from him which openeth
into thoſe things, the which are opened by the Light within that is to ſay,
to draw the mind and inward ſenſes from the Light into the Letter, and from
the word into the words, and from him which openeth, into the things which are
opened; and if Antichriſt hath thus but once captivated the mind, then he
will ſoon finiſh his work, and the Creature ſhall not diſcern it for
the preſent; for Antichriſt he will bring a Vail over the underſtandings
of Men and Women, and yet they for the preſent cannot perceive it; and thus
the Woman, which is one with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part, both in the Male and in
the Female, ſhe having received the things which were opened by the Spirit of
truth, ſhe aſſuming authority to her ſelf to ſpeak in the Church, not
from him which opens, but from thoſe things which are opened, Antechriſt
being transformed in the mind and underſtanding: Now this Woman ſhe is not
permitted by the Law, which is Light, not to ſpeak in the Church with a vocal
voice, neither is ſhe to pray in the Church, but ſhe is to return to
Chriſt, who is the Light within, who daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers her ſtate and
condition unto her, and alſo makes manifeſt her ſin; and her place is to
obey the Light, and to be made willing to dwell in ſilence, until the Light
within hath redeemed her from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of death and darkneſs within,
and then the power which hath redeemed her, he is to ſpeak in the Church, and
not the Woman; but her place is to wait at the feet of Chriſt the Light
within; for ſhe is neither to preach nor pray in the Church, although ſhe
be redeemed: but if ſhe lacks any thing, ſhe is to ask her Husband at home;
for there is an inviſible woman in every viſible man, and there is an
inviſible man in every viſible woman; and the man Chriſt Jefus, who is
the Light of the world, he is in them both, and it is he which is to ſpeak in
the Church, and not the woman, for her place is to be obedient, and in
ſubjection to her Husband; for the firſt viſible man God formed of the
duſt of the ground, and God created and made the firſt inviſible man
<hi>Adam</hi> a living Soul, and he was under the dominion of the heavenly
power and ſpirit, and then he was a heavenly man; but he lending an ear to
the Serpent when he ſpake in the woman, and by his receiving of his
counſel, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent beguiled him, as he had done the woman, and ſo he
loſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the heavenly power, and ſo he became like the woman,
he being brought under the dominion of the earthly ſpirit and power, 

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172147:3"/>
and ſo he loſt his habitation in God, and was brought
under the power of death.</p>
               <p>Friends, I do not own the judgement and opinion of thoſe
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, nor yet their ſuperiority, who ſaith, he that is not
juſtified by the witneſs of God in friends, is condemned by it in
himſelf: now Juſtification is by Chriſt alone, who is the head in every
member, and the only rule for them to walk by; and if they ſin againſt him,
then he is their reprover, and alſo their condemner and chaſtiſer.</p>
               <p>And again, you ſay in your paper, that none are to miniſter,
but thoſe who are reconciled to the Church, and have the approbation of the
Elders. Now the Scripture ſaith, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the
world unto himſelf, and not to the Church, I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no ſuch
Scripture. Now Chriſt the Light within, he will not give his power and
authority out of his own hand to any man or men; for unto him alone is all
Judgement in Heaven and Earth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in matters of conſcience; but you
ſay it is abominable pride in any who will not admit of any Judgment to take
place againſt them whom you do look upon as an offender; but I ſay, all
power both to judge and to condemn, and alſo to juſtifie and to reconcile,
it properly belongs to the Light, who is the head in every member: Wherefore
this is my teſtimony, that you never received your authority from God, who is
the Light within, neither will the Scriptures juſtifie your authority:
Wherefore I would have you in Gods witneſs ſeriouſly to conſider, what
you have done in putting that writing of yours upon record, for that may prove
as great a ſnare to the generation of the Quakers in ages to come, as the
authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been to the Papiſts in ages and
generations paſt, and is to this day.</p>
               <p>And Friends, this I have further to bear my teſtimony
againſt, that is, your impoſing ſuch Books upon Friends, as you ſhall
think good to put to print. When theſe Books came firſt into the Country
among the Churches called Quakers, then every member was left free, either to
buy them, or to let them alone; and if Friends did not buy them, nor they could
not be ſold to others, then they were to be returned to the quarterly meeting
again, and then the thing was well; but now it is not ſo: for now the
Churches muſt take them off, and that which is almoſt as bad, is this, that
the money which is gathered as collection amongſt us, for the relief of the
poor, out of that money the books muſt be paid for, and ſo the old
Engliſh Proverb is fulfilled, the poor muſt pay for all. Friends, this is a
thing I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, was ſcarce ever heard of, that ſome ſhould print
packets of 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172147:3"/>
ſeveral books, and injoyn others to buy them:
Friends, in theſe things you do not only put a yoak of Bondage upon your
Brethren, but you alſo rob God of his honour, whoſe right it is alone both
to rule and raign in the Churches, and to have the dominion over them,
becauſe that he by his inviſible ſpirit and power at firſt did gather
them; for there is ſo much of his ſpirit and power both manifeſted and
given to man and woman, that if they hear the ſpirit, and own Chriſt the
Light within, and believe in him, and obey his voice, that then he will
manifeſt his power, in the redeeming their Souls from death to life; for it
is not Chriſt the Light in me which can redeem neither man nor woman; neither
is it Chriſt the Light in any man or men, neither Churches nor Bodies which
can redeem my Soul from death to life; wherefore your dictates and
impoſitions is no rule for me to walk by, except that Chriſt the Light in
you can do theſe things following for me, which Chriſt the Light in me, is
able to do for me, and alſo for all that hears his voice and obeys him. For
Chriſt the Light within me is able to bruiſe the Serpents head, and he is
able to break down the partition Wall that ſeparates between God and my Soul,
and he is able to open my underſtanding, and to open the book of the
Scriptures, and alſo rend the vail of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and he is able to
make me wiſer then all my teachers, he is able to cleanſe my Soul from
ſin, and to give me true reſt and peace, and he is able to ſanctifie both
Soul and Body, he is able to redeem my Soul to himſelf, and to keep me in the
greateſt hour of temptation that can come upon me, and the Light within is
able to reconcile both man and woman to God again, and Chriſt the Light
within is able to lead him into captivity who hath captivated my Soul, and he
is able to give life to my Soul, and to raiſe it from under the power of
death and darkneſs, and to tranſlate it into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Light and
Life, he is alſo able to break, and he is alſo able to bind up that which
he hath broken, and to heal that which he hath wounded, and to convince the
whole world of ſin, and he is able to Juſtifie both man and woman.</p>
               <p>If either Men, Miniſters or Elders, Bodies or Churches, are
able to do any of theſe foregoing things for me, then ſhall their dictates
and impoſitions be a rule for me to walk by.</p>
               <p>Now I do believe, that God who is Light, and ſhews unto man
his thoughts, that he is infallible, and that there is no fallibility attends
him, but there is a fallibility attends all thoſe who are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and
born of the Spirit of God who is Light, and that it is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172147:4"/>
poſſible for them to err from the Light again, the enemy which is
the power of darkneſs preſenting to them the fruit of the tree of knowledge
whilſt they are in <hi>Eden,</hi> their minds taking delight in it, and they
feeding upon it, the enemy hath power to draw their minds out of <hi>Eden</hi>
again.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I do believe, that I ought not to ſubject my ſelf
to what the Church impoſeth; for then I muſt believe, that it is God in
them which doth impoſe thoſe Yoakes of bondage upon their Brethren, and
alſo that the Church is infallible, and cannot erre, which thing I do not
believe, for then I muſt believe theſe ſeveral particulars
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, I muſt believe that they are as infallible as
God is, and that it is as impoſſible for them to erre, as it is for God to
erre.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That no man nor woman ſhall ever attain to any
higher meaſure of the grace of God then they, and that they are come to the
higheſt Revelation that can be attainable by the Spirit of God.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, And that there is no more to be made known by the
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, in the Sons and Daughters of men, but what is already made
known to them.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, Or if there be any thing more to be revealed by
the ſpirit of God, that God will make it known to them, and to none elſe:
the which thing I cannot believe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Friends, I would have you ſeriouſly to take into your
conſideration ſome of your Doctrines and Principles which are commonly
preached amongſt us, how they can ſtand with Gods Soveraignty, Dominion,
and Glory, that either the Seed or God ſhould ariſe in man.</p>
               <p>Whether the Light or Spirit, Seed and God, be not all one and
the ſame thing? And how came this Seed of God to be under, or beneath in man?
And by what ſhall this Seed or God in man, be raiſed again? and from whence
ſhall that power come, the which ſhall raiſe up God or the Seed in Man
into his Dominion again, if he hath loſt his Kingdom in man, ſeeing that

               <p>And whether the appearance of God in man, to man by his Spirit,
be not for the quickning and raiſing of man, both Soul and Body, out of a

out of bondage or captivity, for the Light or the Creator hath not been in
bondage and captivity, but the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that God made in man, that hath
been both in bondage and captivity, being under the power of Darkneſs, for
God hath not

God, whilſt man and woman hath been loſt.</p>

               <p>For man in the beginning was created in the Light, and the
Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was near him, but yet the Light had dominion over him, and it was
his habitation; but <hi>Adam</hi> went out of <hi>Eden</hi> in the day of his
tranſgreſſion; and then God curſed the Serpent, and he alſo judged
man for his diſobedience, and he was driven out of the Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of
his ſin and tranſgreſſion: but ſtill God kept his dominion in the
Garden over man to his condemnation; and he placed the flaming Sword at
<hi>Edens</hi> gate, to keep the way of the tree of Life, againſt the firſt
man <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo long as he did abide in a ſtate of ſin and
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
               <p>Friends, the Kingdom of Heaven is within all men and women, and
Heaven is above Hell, and the Light is above Darkneſs, in all the Sons and
Daughters of men, and Life is above death, and truth is above error; and God
that made the world, is in the world, and above the God of the world; and the
Light is the higher power, and Gods Throne is above the Devils in all the Sons
and Daughters of men, yea in the wickedſt of men, the ſeed in both man and
woman, it is both God and Chriſt, and it is above the ſeed of the Serpent
in all, as he is in himſelf, and his dominion is over all, who is God
bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>The ſeed is to redeem, and not to be redeemed, the ſoul is
to be awakened, and to be quickned by the ſeed that never ſinned, and to be
raiſed from under the power of death, and to be brought up into dominion by
the ſpirit of Life over the power of death; for the ſeed within muſt
bruiſe the Serpents head within, and deliver the Soul from under the power of
death within: for the ſeed is to quicken, and not to be quickened; and God is
to raiſe, and not to be raiſed: Gods Throne is eſtabliſhed in Juſtice
and Judgement in wicked men over them to their condemnation, becauſe of their
ſin and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and his Throne is alſo eſtabliſhed in
love and mercy over them that obey him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:172147:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Light is to deſcend, and the day
ſpring from on high is to viſit the ſouls of the Sons and Daughters of
men, for they are to be lifted up by the arm of Gods power revealed from
Heaven, for man had his habitation in God once, but man loſt his habitation
in God, but God kept his habitation in man: for the power of God in man, he is
above the Devils power in man; for God that made man is in him, and man is not
above his maker, nor the Creature is not above his Creator. God who made all
things by the word of his power, and man alſo in his power, this God was
never diſthroned, but man was diſpoſſeſſed of his habitation in
God, in the day of his tranſgreſſion againſt God; for the Mount
<hi>Sion</hi> is above Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the heavenly
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is above the houſe of Bondage, and God who is the Judge
of all, he is in all, yea and above all, that is in man, or ever was in man,
who is God comprehended in himſelf, bleſſed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For God never loſt his Kingdom nor Dominion in man, although
the Devil and man both loſt their firſt habitation in God; and the Devil is
never like to enjoy his again; but there is hopes for man and woman, through
their believing in the Light, and receiving of the truth, for them to receive
life again: Wherefore I do own the Light, the Life, the ſpirit and power in
man to be both the reſurrection and the life, as he is in himſelf, and he
is alſo both man and womans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as by his power within their ſouls
comes to be raiſed from death to life again; but I deny the reſurrection of
the power and ſpirit of God in man or woman, or that ever the ſeed, which
is Gods ſpirit and power, that it ever came under the Devils power in man or
woman, or that ever the Devil had dominion over God; wherefore God is not to
ariſe in man nor woman, but we are to be raiſed by the arme of his power
revealed from Heaven within, for the man-child hath been caught up to God in
this long night of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy which hath been over the <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
wherefore Chriſt the Light within, ſtands in need of no bleſſing, for
he is everlaſtingly bleſſed and happy in himſelf, without either
beginning of days, or end of life; and there is a bleſſing to be revealed
from Heaven in the ſeed, unto all that believe in God and obey him, which is
Chriſt the Light within; for Friends, the Light in man was never blinded,
neither was the ſeed by the earthly power never covered, but the Light hath
all along diſcovered mans ſin unto him, neither hath mans mind been
blinded, ſo that he could not ſee, nor yet behold that glory, the which was
to be revealed in the Light, and his mind alſo was blinded, ſo 

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:172147:5"/>
as he could no way find power againſt ſin, that ſo he
might eſcape the wrath which was due unto him for his ſin and
tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>For Friends, the power of darkneſs, which is the Devil, ever
ſince the day he was caſt down from Heaven, he could never get up into
Heaven ſince, although he may have aſſumed to do ſuch a thing, but he
had power to draw our firſt Parents out of Heaven, but it was by their
yielding to his temptation, that it came to be ſo with <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> and ſo he got the dominion over both their Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and all that God had made by his power within them, and if the Serpent could
never get up into Heaven again, then I am ſure he could never get above
Heaven, nor yet above the Seed, nor yet above the Life which is the Light in
every man and woman; but the Devil hath had dominion over us both Souls and
Bodies; for we being by ſin and tranſgreſſion made partakers of his
nature, were Children of wrath as well as others. Wherefore the Seed is not to
ariſe in man, nor yet to be brought up into his Kingdom, except God had
loſt his Kingdom and power in man, the which he never did: and if he had
loſt his Kingdom and power in man, from whence ſhall that power come, that
ſhall bring him up into his Kingdom and power again: but man and woman they
are to be awakened by the Lords Trumpet, which from Heaven within hath
ſounded, and the Souls which have been dead as to God (and buried in the
grave of ſin and death, which both was and is, the power of darkneſs, which
is the Devil) they are to hear the voice of the Son of God (from within) who
have ſlept the ſleep of death under the power of ſin, they are to ariſe
from the dead by hearing and obeying the voice of the Son of God within, and
ſo read <hi>Lazarus</hi> the Figure, who had been buried four days, how the
Trumpet ſounded from Heaven, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raiſed, and ſo
muſt we be raiſed, by the ſame voice, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and power, muſt we
come both to feel and witneſs Chriſt the Light within, to be our
reſurrection and our life, by feeling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his power revealed from
Heaven within, to the raiſing of our Souls out of the grave of death and
ſin, the which both our Souls and Bodies have been buryed in; for it is we
that are to be raiſed from under the bondage of corruption by the Spirit that
never ſinned, nor yet ſaw corruption; for its we that have been ſown in
weakneſs, that are to be raiſed by the arm of Gods power revealed; for its
we that have been ſown in diſhonour, which are to be raiſed up by the
ſpirit of Glory; for its we that have born the image of the earthly man, who
are to bear the image of the heavenly man, as our Souls
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172147:6"/>
come
to be raiſed from death to life again: for it was the firſt man
<hi>Adam</hi> who was made a living Soul, that was degenerated, and by reaſon
of his ſin and tranſgreſſion from the life, was alienated, and he
alſo by the power of death was captivated; therefore it is the firſt man
<hi>Adam</hi> that is to be both awakened and quickned, and raiſed by the arm
of Gods power revealed from Heaven within; and he muſt alſo receive power
from the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who is a quickening ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Lord
from Heaven, by which he comes to be made willing to put off the old man and
his deeds, which is the power of darkneſs. And ſo the firſt man
<hi>Adam</hi> comes to be reſtored to God again, by his putting on the new
man, as he witneſſes, being regenerate and born again of the ſpirit of
God.</p>

                     <p>I have received thy teſtimony and declaration of thy Faith,
but as ſoon as I looked on a few words, I ſoon eſpyed thy Subtilty. Thou
ſaiſt, that thou owneſt Salvation by no other Chriſt but by him that
dwelt in that body when it was upon the earth, how canſt thou prove that
Chriſt in that body, to be Chriſt without that body; for both that body and
ſpirit in that body, maketh that man Chriſt Jeſus. For if that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in that body, be Chriſt without that body, then that Eternal Spirit dyed upon
the Croſs, becauſe Chriſt dyed for our ſins according to the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but I think thou wilt not ſay the Godhead is dead, becauſe thou
ſaiſt, it is revealed in every man; ſo then, if that ſpirit in that
body, be not Chriſt without that body, but both body and ſpirit make that
man Chriſt Jeſus. And thou owneſt ſalvation by that ſpirit onely
without that body, thou owneſt not ſalvation by Chriſt. O
<hi>Jeffery!</hi> why wilt thon deny the Lord that hath bought thee with his
own blood, and bring upon thy ſelf deſtruction? for the Godhead dyed not,
as I have told thee, but that body was made a curſe by dying that curſed
death upon the Tree, to take off the curſe from them that believe that
ſacrifice for ſin, which was a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to the Lord. By
which body offered up, he hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified;
which ſacrificed body and offered up bloud, if thou reject, how canſt thou
have thy curſed ſins pardoned, thy defiled conſcience purged; for without
ſhedding of bloud there is no remiſſion. But I will tell thee my Faith, I
do own ſalvation cometh alone by that man Chriſt Jeſus, the only Son of
God, who was born of that Eſpouſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who was Crucified
at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> by which curſed death, he did there make an
attonement for all, and full ſatisfaction to God the Father, for the ſins
of all that believe in him from the heart, and obey his holy will revealed in
his word, the holy Scriptures of truth that are able to make the man of God
wiſe unto ſalvation, <hi>1 Pet. 2.24. Heb. 10.14. Joh. 20.31. Mat. 7.24,25.

                     <p>The holy Spirit of God I own and eſteem; for it is that
which, Firſt, made me to ſee into my ſins, and my curſed eſtate by
ſin, according as is made known in the Scriptures of truth. 2ly. It did
ſhed the love of God abroad in my ſoul, how that Chriſt had dyed for my
ſins. 3ly. He
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172147:7"/>
did help me to lay hold upon the hope ſet
before me, without whoſe help I can do nothing. 4ly. He did work in my Soul a
cruel hatred againſt all known ſins, in thoughts, words, and works. 5ly. He
did work in my Soul a great love to my God, and to his Son Jeſus, to his
Children, to all known good, in words and works, in my ſelf and others. 6ly.
He did aſſure me of redemption of my ſoul, and forgiveneſs of my ſins
through the bloud of my Lord Jeſus, that was ſhed upon the Croſs for me.
7ly. He did ſeal home the promiſes of Eternal Glory to my Sonl, promiſed
in the Scriptures of truth to the Sons of God. 8ly. He did work in my Soul holy
reformation, and godly reſolutions, to do and obey whatever my God ſhall
make known unto me to be his will and mind by his ſpirit and word the
Scriptures, and that unto death. 9ly. It did fill my Soul with praiſes to the
God of my life night and day, praiſing him in the ſpirit, admiring his love
to my ſoul, in redeeming it with ſo great a price, as the blood of his own
Son. 10ly. The holy ſpirit did alſo comfort me and quicken me, and made me
greatly to rejoyce, with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory; the which
ſpirit of my God ſtill is with me, and giveth me that peace no man can take
from me; by whoſe help, my deſire is to my God, I might ſtill be
preſerved, and hold faſt the precious faith which I have attained, through
the Grace of God, and my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, until he ſhall come in

things I own; thou askeſt me how I can prove Chriſt in that body, to be
Chriſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:172147:7"/>
without that body: I can prove it both by
<hi>Pauls</hi> teſtimony, and alſo by the ſame ſpirit of God the which
<hi>Paul</hi> did prove it by, who told the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> the Fathers
drank of the Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt; and he alſo
told the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that the myſtery which had been hid from
ages and generations paſt, was Chriſt within, the hope of glory, and alſo
Chriſts viſible appearance came in that preſent age; but his inviſible
appearance had been hid from ages and generations paſt; for Chriſt was with
his Church in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                     <p>Again, thou ſaiſt, that body, and ſpirit in that body,
maketh that man Chriſt Jeſus. Now the ſpirit in that body was the
Godhead, and thou ſaiſt, that the Godhead dyed not, and thou ſpeakeſt
true, for ſo ſay I: ſo then it was only that part which the Holy Ghoſt
took from the woman, the which died, and not the Godhead which both was and is
the ſpirit of God; for it was God and the Woman that made the viſible man
Chriſt; for he was made of a Woman, made under the Law, as ſaith the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for <hi>Mary</hi> ſhe knew no viſible man.</p>
                     <p>Now curſed be that ſpirit that ſhall deny the blood of
Chriſt, or the end for which Chriſts body was offered up, and blood was
ſhed: for I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all the world were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son, and that all men were freed from their outward offerings for
ſin, by that one offering; and that after the ſhedding of the blood of that
viſible man Chriſt upon the Croſs, there was to be no more outward
killing the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor yet ſhedding of blood for remiſſion of
ſins.</p>
                     <p>But this was not the fleſh and the blood which Chriſt
ſpeaks of when he was upon the earth, when he ſaid <hi>He that eateth my
fleſh and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my blood, he dwelleth in me, and I in him:</hi> and he
was then upon the earth, as a man, like one of us, ſin only excepted, when he
ſpake theſe words. So Friend, if thou knoweſt no other body, nor blood to
feed upon, but that which dyed and was ſhed out of Chriſts body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thy Soul may periſh, for all the knowledge
which thou haſt of the Scriptures. Now Chriſt, in the days of his fleſh,
exhorted people to believe in the Light, and to bring their deeds to the Light,
that ſo they might be made Children of the Light; for he knew that they were
Children of the Darkneſs, and God he is Light, and ſhews unto man his
thoughts, who ſaid, <hi>look unto me all yea ends of the earth, and be
ſaved,</hi> and ſome of theſe words were ſpoken by the Lord in his
Prophets before Chriſts body came into the world, and the ſame that ever
was, the Saviour now is, and not another; for God is not changed, neither is
his ſalvation changed.</p>
                     <p>Again, thou ſaiſt, thou know eſt the Father, and thou
knoweſt the Son,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172147:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the holy Spirit. Friend, conſider
well what thou haſt written; and let Gods Spirit in thee try thy words,
whether thou haſt thy knowledge of God, and his Son, and holy Spirit, in and
from the Spirit of Revelation, for Chriſt ſaith, no man knows the Father
ſave the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in him;</hi> ſo then there is no true
ſaving knowledge, of neither Father nor Son, but in and through the Spirit of
Revelation: ſo conſider, and let Gods witneſs judge in thee, whether thy
knowledge ſtands in the Light, or in the Letter, in the myſtery, or in the
hiſtory, in the word, or in the words, the which were given forth from the
word, for the words were given forth in time, from the word which was before
time was. And ſo remember what the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to Chriſt (who had
the Scriptures before the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) how they ſaid, that they were
<hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, and God was their Father, and they were
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſciples, and that God ſpake to <hi>Moſes.</hi> But
they ſpeaking concerning Chriſt, ſaid, <hi>as for this fellow we know not
whence he is;</hi> and theſe were the blind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <hi>Jews</hi> who
had the Scriptures; <hi>but they had neither heard the voice of God at any
time, nor yet ſeen his ſhape,</hi> as Chriſt in plain words tells them;
and yet how great was their boaſting; and all this while they had but a blind
zeal, for a vail of thick darkneſs was over their minds and
underſtandings.</p>
                     <p>Again, thou ſaiſt, the holy Scriptures thou knoweſt to
be the mind and will of God, then thy ſoul, and mind, and underſtanding,
they muſt be in the myſtery and ſpirit of God which gave forth the

Friend, <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry
ſtood in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, and he deſired only to know
Chriſt according to the ſpirit, but not after the fleſh; <hi>for that
which is born of the fleſh is fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit
is ſpirit,</hi> as ſaith the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This following was given me (from the Quakers) to
ſubſcribe, which I refuſed to do, for reaſons inſerted.</hi>
               </p>

                           <p>FOr the clearing of the precious truth of God,
profeſſed by us his people called Quakers, from the occaſion of reproach
and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, given by <hi>Jeffery Bullock,</hi> his pernicious doctrine,
in affirming, That he neither expects Juſtification nor Condemnation by that
Chriſt that dyed, or was put to death at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Theſe are to
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie all Friends, and Friendly people whom it may concern, that we
teſtifie againſt this Doctrine, as ſtated by him, as both pernicious and
Antichriſtian, and contrary to plain Scripture, and the conſtant
te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony faithfully born amongſt us from the beginning; for neither do we
profeſs and preach two Chriſts, nor yet own Juſtification by any other
Chriſt, or in any other Name, but by and in the Name of that very one
Chriſt of God, to whom the holy Prophets and Apoſtles gave witneſs in the
ſcriptures of truth, who was miraculouſly conceived by the Holy Ghoſt,
overſhadowing the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and put to death
in the fleſh (without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) but quickned by the
Spirit, whom God raiſed from the dead, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. We muſt
confeſs with the holy Apoſtles, that even by him, (to wit that very
Chriſt) all that believe, are juſtified from all things from which they
could not be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 13.30,39. and
that remiſſion of ſins, Juſtification, and Salvation, as then preacht
in the name of the ſame Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by his Eternal power and
ſpirit of God, ſo the ſame is conſtantly believed and witneſſed
amongſt us. And although the beſt fenſe that we can ſuppoſe, or
gather, as aimed at by the ſaid <hi>Jeffery Bullock,</hi> is, that it is not
only by the ſuffering and death of Chriſt, nor by a mere literal knowledge
of him, as after the fleſh, that men can be either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly juſtified or
ſaved from ſin and death, any more then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or primitive
Chriſtians were; but by his life, ſpirit and power, operating in them. And
ſo by a living and ſpiritual knowledge of Chriſt, as after the Spirit;
which though the truth of this we cannot but own and juſtifie, yet this
cannot excuſe the aforecited Doctrine,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:172147:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as laid down,
which denies both Juſtification and Condemnation by that Chriſt that dyed;
for that ſuppoſeth another Chriſt for that end, and ſo two Chriſts.
And therefore the ſaid <hi>J. B.</hi> ought to ſee his error, and call back
and recant of his words, which have given occaſion of ſtumbling in
<hi>Sudbury.</hi> Whereas, the very Chriſt, the Son of God, is but one,
though he hath often and variouſly manifeſted himſelf from the beginning,
as both before he came in the fleſh, and in the fulneſs of time in the
fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> that body that was prepared for him to do the will of
his Father in; and ſince in ſpirit for the everlaſting comfort and
ſalvation of all them who believe in his name and power, which by his divine
Light within is livingly revealed; And we confeſs, that this Son of God, our
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt our Lord was made of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi>
according to the fleſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Son of God, with power
according to the ſpirit of holyneſs by the reſurrection from the dead:
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3,4. And that that very Chriſt that came of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> as concerning the fleſh, is God over all, God bleſſed
for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. So that he is truly and inſeparably God and Man,
according to the Scripture: And even that very Chriſt who was crucified and
ſlain, hath God lifted up with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour,
<hi>Acts</hi> 5.30,31. And God will judge the the world in righteouſneſs,
by that man whom he hath ordained, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. So we muſt confeſs
with the Apoſtles, that to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are
all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all
things, and we him: And further, we cannot own any ſuch Doctrine or Words,
(by whomſoever ſpoken) as tend to undervalue the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, death, and
blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. for not only a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation was
declared and made through his death, but all his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and his being the
one univerſal Offering and Sacrifice, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to mans redemption, and
the ſalvation to all that truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Name, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17.
though without the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and being born again of the
living word and ſpirit of life, none do really partake of eternal
ſalvation, or that redemption which is obtained through the blood of
Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity.</p>

Friends, What you have written in
contradiction to my words, it is both Romiſh and Antichriſtian Doctrine,
and contrary to the Scriptures of truth, and form of ſound words.</p>
               <p>Now it is no where written in the Scriptures, that we ſhall
either be Juſtified or Condemned by that Chriſt which dyed without the
Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but it is written, <hi>by Grace ye are
ſaved,</hi> and <hi>by Grace ye are juſtified;</hi> and it is alſo
written, <hi>by the Light of the world ye are condemned;</hi> and not by
Chriſt that dyed without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the ſame ſpirit which quickned that body of Jeſus when
it lay under the earth, yea, and the ſame God that raiſed up that body, do
I own to be both my Juſtifier, and alſo my condemner, if I ſin againſt
him. Yea, the ſame God which raiſed up <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the Grave,
who dwelt in Chriſts Temple when it was upon the Earth, the ſame God do I
own ſalvation by, that is he the which both did and doth, ſhew unto man his
thoughts, who ſaid, <hi>look unto me all ye ends of the Earth, and be
ſaved; for I am God, and there is none elſe;</hi> and he did not bid the
ends of the earth look to him that was to come, but unto him who was already in
them, and did ſhew them their thoughts; and this was not Chriſts outward
viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but it was Gods inviſible power which was in the Sons
and Daughters of men: the fulneſs of which power and ſpirit, dwelt in
Chriſts body when it was upon the Earth. And this is God who was in the
beginning, and alſo before the beginning, and alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning of
dayes, or end of life; and this is the ſalvation of the ends of the earth,
who never dyed, otherwiſe you muſt conclude the Godhead dyed, as well as
the viſible man Chriſt; the which is blaſphemy for any to affirm; and it
is quite contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the which ſaith, <hi>that he,</hi>
through the Eternal Spirit, <hi>offered up himſelf a ſacrifice once for
all;</hi> and he alſo gave up his Soul an Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for ſin: And I do
alſo believe, there is ſomething of God in me, that is both without
beginning of days or end of life; and this is a meaſure or manifeſtation of
the Spirit of God, the fulneſs of which dwelt in Chriſts body when it was
upon the Earth; and this is both my God and Saviour, and Juſtifier, if I obey
him, and alſo my condemner if I ſin againſt him. Now the Law of
<hi>Moſes</hi> that was never written to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> neither had
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> any command from God, for the obſervation of it,
therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> they could never be Juſtified by it,
becauſe they had no command for the keeping of it; but on the contrary, the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> were reproved by <hi>Paul</hi> for

the obſervation
of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now God was in all thoſe viſible appearances amongſt the
<hi>Jews,</hi> yet it was by his inviſible power by which he wrought thoſe
ſigns and wonders amongſt the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and it was by his
inviſible power, by the which <hi>Aarons</hi> rod budded, the pot of
<hi>Manna</hi> was preſerved: And it was the Lords inviſible Glory which
filled the Tabernacle, and unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> he appeared as a Fire by
night, and as a cloud by day; and after this God ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi>
within the cloud, and after theſe things he inviſibly appeared, ond dwelt
in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; and then at laſt, the Holy Ghoſt
overſhadowed the Virgin, and God prepared a Temple for himſelf by his
inviſible ſpirit and power, the which Temple was the Son of God, by
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God; in which Temple there dwelt the fulneſs of the Godhead
bodily; and when the Son of God, or the Lamb of God, had finiſhed his
teſtimony in this world, he then did, (through the Eternal Spirit which dwelt
in his Temple) offer up himſelf a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice once for all. Then was all
outward Temple worſhip ended; for the glory of God out of <hi>Solomons</hi>
then departed; <hi>For then the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain,</hi> and
alſo the worſhip was ended, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord once gave the <hi>Jews</hi>
a command for the obſerving of it. But as for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they
never had no command from God for the practiſing of thoſe things; therefore
what they did, they did it by imitation, and not by commandment.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt he was not the Son of <hi>David,</hi> as by
generation from <hi>David,</hi> as he was a viſible man; for <hi>Mary</hi>
ſhe was a Virgin, and knew no viſible man: but Chriſt he was the Son of
<hi>David</hi> by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God, he being begotten by the ſpirit of
God in the Womb of the Virgin, and this was the ſpirit of God in
<hi>David,</hi> from which ſpirit <hi>David</hi> received power to be
regenerated and born again; and this was the fleſh of <hi>David,</hi> and
this was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt he was not the Son of a viſible man, but he was
the Son of a viſible woman, he being begotten by an inviſible power and
ſpirit: now if ſalvation be by that Chriſt that dyed without the Gates at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then are all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> periſhed that were
in the world before that body came into the world; for I do not read, that ever
any of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſaw the coming of that viſible man Chriſt,
whenas the world had continued near four thouſand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came into
the world: yea, all the <hi>Jews</hi> that were in the world before that body
came, and did not ſee the coming of that body, nor own it when it did come,
they likewiſe are periſhed; yea, all both <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> the which have been in the world ſince
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172147:11"/>
thoſe dayes, who have not owned him to be the Chriſt and the
Saviour of the world, who dyed without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they
like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are all periſhed; but, and if ſalvation be by him that ſhews
unto man his thoughts, and reproveth man, and alſo convinceth him, and
condemneth man and woman for their ſin, and ſheweth unto them their ſtate
and condition, then the Saviour and Salvation of the ends of the earth, hath
been both within man and woman ever ſince the day of their firſt
creation.</p>
               <p>For, although the Lord came in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and begot the
type in <hi>Sarah,</hi> when it ceaſed to be with <hi>Sarah</hi> after the
manner of women, even ſo the Lord, when the fulneſs of time was come, he,
by the Holy Ghoſt, overſhadowed the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and he begot the
Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type in her, who was the end of all Types, without her having any
knowledge of a viſible man, but theſe things did but little concern the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> although we have the hiſtory of them, only all the world
was freed from their offerings for ſin by that one offering; and alſo they
were outwardly reconciled to God by the death of his Son, and ſo there was to
be no more outward offerings for ſin, but we muſt be redeemed, juſtified,
and alſo ſaved by a meaſure of the ſame life that dwelt in the Son; in
which life, the Son of God offered up his Soul and Body to be crucified to the
death, a ſacrifice once for all, then no ſalvation to the Souls of the Sons
and Daughters of men, by him that dyed without the Gates at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but in and by him alone, who was both without beginning
of dayes, or end of life, a meaſure or a manifeſtation of which ſpirit,
is given to every man, wherein alone ſtands mans Condemnation, Redemption,
Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Life, and Salvation, Reſtauration, and Sanctification; and
this Salvation was in the world before Chriſts body came; and the ſame that
ever was the Saviour, now is, and not another: ſo he that dyed without the
Gates at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the man in the myſtery, the myſtery
being in him, he being one with the myſtery, was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the
myſtery; and ſo he was the Chriſt of God, being one with the Spirit of
God, but it was the womans part that dyed, that was his Soul and Body; for it
was <hi>Eve</hi> that had been in the tranſgreſſion: but the mans part,
which was the Godhead that dwelt in that body, he never ſinned, nor yet ſaw
corruption; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he never dyed, and that both was and is he, which ever
liveth, and was without beginning of dayes or end of life.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt, as he was a viſible man, and made of a viſible
woman, made under the Law, he internally dyed, as to his Soul and Body, 

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172147:12"/>
and did put an end to all outward external ſacrifices and
ſervices. But the Chriſt, the myſtery, the light, the life, and the word
of eternal life, and the ſalvation of the ends of the earth, the which dwelt
in that body, he never dyed. Now I do deny, that ever any man or woman, either
was or ſhall be, redeemed from death to life by that blood, the which was
ſpilt without the Gates at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or that ever any did drink
of that outward blood, or that ever any were inwardly cleanſed from ſin by
that outward blood, and what are all outward cleanſings, if ſo be the heart
and conſcience be defiled. Wherefore every one that comes to be inwardly
cleanſed, it muſt be in and by the receiving and enjoying a meaſure of
the ſame life, the fulneſs of which life dwelt in Chriſts body when it
was upon the earth, the which ſpirit God hath poured forth upon all the Sons
and Daughters of men, wherein alone, Life and Salvation, Juſtification and
Condemnation is placed, and this is Gods own ſpirit, and the inviſible man
Chriſt, whom God hath by his own right hand exalted in the Sons and Daughters
of men, both as a Prince and a Saviour. Firſt as a Prince, in manifeſting
his power to condemn both man and woman becauſe of their ſin and rebellion,
and diſobedience againſt him: And ſecondly, as a Saviour, both to redeem
them, juſtifie them, and alſo to ſave them, if they come to have their
minds turned to him, and to believe in him, and obey him.</p>
               <p>Now it is the mans part, wherein the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi>
was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the which God hath exalted as a Prince and a Saviour, that is he
which never ſinned; and not <hi>Eve</hi> the womans part, which by the
Serpent was lead into ſin and tranſgreſſion, that part hath not God
exalted as a Prince and a Saviour; for ſhe was to be redeemed both Soul and
Body; and ſo it was <hi>Eve</hi> the firſt woman which was in the
tranſgreſſion, and not God, who made the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> a
living Soul, which Soul was lead into tranſgreſſion, by yielding to the
councel of the Serpent in <hi>Eve,</hi> the firſt woman; for there is a Soul,
or an inviſible woman, the which God did make and place in every viſible
man; and this is ſhe that hath born the image of the earthly man, and hath
been one with the Serpent, and now ſhe is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, regenerated, and
born again of the Spirit of God, who is the heavenly man; and this is the
ſeed, the which every inviſible woman, in every viſible man, is to bear,
which ſeed alone hath power to bruiſe the Serpents head in every viſible
man and woman; and this muſt be done before ſhe can truly bear the image of
the heavenly man again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:172147:12"/>
For <hi>Eve</hi> ſhe was a viſible
woman, but ſhe conceived and bore the firſt inviſible man, who was that
ſon of perdition; and the power of darkneſs, which brought death over all
that God had made in the Sons and Daughters of men, as to the inviſible
creation of God; but the Lords promiſe both was and is, <hi>that he would
create all things new,</hi> and the Lords new Creation it is inviſible; for
although <hi>Mary</hi> did bear that viſible man Chriſt, who was begotten
in and by an inviſible power and ſpirit; yet ſhe ſtood in need of God
to be her Saviour: for ſhe ſaith, <hi>her ſoul did magnifie the Lord, and
her ſpirit did rejoyce in God her Saviour;</hi> and I do believe, that after
ſhe was delivered of that viſible man Chriſt, that ſtill her God and
Saviour did remain in her, although that viſible babe was outwardly
ſeparated from her; and ſo I do believe, that whatſoever was given forth
in time among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as concerning all outward worſhip, in time
it was ended when Chriſts body was offered up, and the belief and faith of
all, muſt ſtand in the myſtery of that Light and Life which God hath now
in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> revealed; and Antichriſts faith and belief, which he
hath brought in among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in this night of Apoſtacy, that
muſt be overturned both root and branch, by the Light which God hath
revealed.</p>
               <p>Friends, I do believe that this writing of mine, that it is

Now that there is two Chriſts, it
is plain according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for there is both the true Chriſt, and
Antichriſt. Now Chriſts viſible appearance among the <hi>Jews,</hi> he
was called Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit in offering up his body,
he ended all the viſible diſpenſations among the <hi>Jews;</hi> but it
was Gods inviſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance throughout all ages, the which brought unto
the Sons and Daughters of men, ſalvation to their Souls, and he is called
Chriſt within, the hope of glory, and the myſtery that had been hid from
ages and generations paſt. Now the Prophets they did foreſee the coming of
that body, which was the Son of God, who was to be the end of all thoſe
bodily ſacrifices by which the <hi>Jews</hi> did expect remiſſion of
ſins. Now the ſame God that raiſed up <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he was dead,
and alſo raiſed up Jeſus, or the body of Jeſus, do I own to be both my
God and Saviour.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it did not at all
belong to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were juſtified by
the Law written in their hearts; and ſo muſt we, or elſe we muſt be
condemned: for the Law made nothing perfect, as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had a
command for it, therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could have no advantage by it,
who had no command for the obſerving of it; but on the contrary, they were
reproved by <hi>Paul</hi> for obſerving the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies: but
where the Diſpenſations began, there they alſo ended.</p>
               <p>Now we do no where read of the name Chriſt before that
viſible appearance came into the world; but God ſaid, <hi>look unto me all
ye ends of the earth, and be ſaved, for I am be that ſhews unto man his
thoughts;</hi> and he did not bid them look unto him that was to come, and this
was God, who prepared a body for himſelf, the which was the Son of God by
generation from God, and as a Son he was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the will of his Father,
even unto the death.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt, he neither came of <hi>David,</hi> nor yet of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, not as to his outward
appearance, as he was a viſible man; but he came of <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Iſrael</hi> both, according to the ſpirit; and this is the ſpirit
whom God hath exalted both as a Prince and a Saviour, firſt as a Prince, to
manifeſt his power, to condemn both man and woman becauſe of their ſin
and rebellion, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience againſt him; and ſecondly, as a Saviour,
both to redeem them, and juſtifie them, and alſo to ſave them, if they
come to have their minds turned to him, and to believe in him, and obey him;
for the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> knew no viſible: but now, far be it from me, and
curſed be that ſpirit that ſhall undervalue the ſufferings, death, and 

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172147:13"/>
blood of that holy, juſt, and innocent Lamb of God; but
yet I do not believe, that ever any were redeemed from ſin, or purified,
cleanſed, purged, ſanctified, or ſaved, by that viſible body that dyed,
or blood which was ſhed, without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Paul,</hi> he that was the Apoſtle of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> he defired to know no Chriſt after the fleſh: Now the
<hi>Jews</hi> in the days of Chriſts fleſh ſaid, <hi>that they were</hi>
Moſes <hi>his Diſciples; but as for this fellow, we know not whence he
is.</hi> Now in the Apoſtles dayes there was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Phariſees</hi>
that had believed, who taught the Brethren, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they were
circumciſed, and kept the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not be ſaved,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. Now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, that we muſt be
juſtified, and alſo ſaved, by that Chriſt that dyed at
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and ſo ſaith the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> and
ſo alſo ſaith the body of the Quakers.</p>
               <p>And Friends, Antichriſt he ſtrives to bring in his Doctrine,
and alſo to be head over all thoſe inviſible appearances that comes from
God; but the ſpirit of truth ſaith, that Condemnation, Juſtification,
Redemption, and Sanctification, and Salvation, it is by God alone, who is
Light, and ſheweth unto man his thoughts.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Pauls</hi> teſtimony was in the ſpirit, and not in
the letter, but the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the life of their teſtimony it was
in the Letter or Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who with their Doctrine bewitched the
Churches, and led them into errour, as you may read <hi>Paul</hi> to the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> and alſo to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> how he tells them,
that Satan was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in his Miniſters; for the Book of the
Scriptures both was and is, the fruit which the tree of knowledge bears, both
in their days, and alſo in ours, they being opened by the ſpirit of
truth.</p>
               <p>Friends, it behoves us all to look to our ſtanding, for
Antichriſt is already come in amongſt us, and Satan is already transformed
into an Angel of Light amongſt ſome of our Miniſters, as certainly as
ever he was amongſt the falſe teachers in the Apoſtles days; and if you
will not believe what I have written, then mind well the writing of thoſe
Brethren which call themſelves the Eleven Elders, to the Churches called
Quakers, and ſee if they do not put themſelves into equal power and
authority with God. Friends, firſt the form, and then Antichriſt appears in
the form; but if there be no conformity to the form, then there is no unity to
be enjoy'd with them that uphold the form. So Friends, my dear love is
remembred unto you all, who expect life and ſalvation from God, who is Light,
and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and not from any viſible appearances, although they were
good in their time.</p>

               <p>I do diſown my ſelf to be a Member of the viſible Church
called Quakers, for theſe particular reaſons and cauſes following;
neither do I deſire to have unity, nor to ſeek to have peace with the
Church in thoſe actions wherein they ſet up themſelves as Judges among,
or above their Brethren, as the Eleven Elders called Quakers, have done.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, I diſown all ſuperiority of men, Miniſters,
or Elders, in the Churches called Quakers, or any who aſſume Authority to
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above the reſt of the Members, to judge and determine things in
matters of conſcience, the which thing only belongs to God in every ones own
particular.</item>
                  <item>2. I diſown my ſelf to be a member of that Body or
Church, which ſaith, <hi>He that is not juſtified by the witneſs of God
in Friends, is condemn'd by it in himſelf.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Which ſaith, <hi>That none are to Miniſter or
Preach, but ſuch as are reconciled to the Church, and have the approbation of
the Elders and Members.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Again, I do diſown both the cenſures and judgement
of that body or Church, who look upon themſelves, that they have both a right
and power to judge of errours, and yet have not power to convince the parties
of their errors, before they paſs judgement upon them for thoſe things
which they call errors; for Chriſt, he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth both man and woman of
their evils, before he either judgeth them, or condemneth them for their
evils.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:172147:14"/>
5. Again, I do diſown my ſelf to be
a Member of that Church, who will not admit me to take the liberty of my
Conſcience, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine and Principles in the Worſhip of God,
the outward life and converſation, that being blameleſs, and I being
ſatisfied in my own conſcience, that the thing is both right and true,
which I do own.</item>
                  <item>6. I diſown my ſelf to be a Member of that Church, who
will not admit me to believe and ſpeak, what God by his Spirit makes
manifeſt in me; for the Articles of your Church, Faith, and Belief, they are
concealed from me; ſo that in plain Engliſh words, with ſenſe I cannot
them neither read nor underſtand: ſo that I queſtion, whether this
practice of the Church doth not ſurpaſs plain Popery; for they have given
forth the Articles of their Faith, as concerning Doctrine.</item>
                  <item>7. I diſown the reſurrection of the power, or the
ariſing of the Seed, or God in man, or that ever the Seed or God, was either
in Captivity or Bondage, or that it was ever loſt, or that the Light in man
was ever blinded, or the Image of God defaced, or that the Seed hath been under
the corrupt heart of man, or that ever Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were over it, or that ever
God loſt his Kingdom in man, as he was in himſelf.</item>
                  <item>8. Again, I diſown that to be any true Miniſtry for
God, who in their declaration, do exhort both Friends and other people to come
to a ſenſe, and to wait in a ſenſe, and to abide in a ſenſe, and
continue in a ſenſe; for God is not a ſenſe, neither is his ſpirit a
ſenſe; for the ſenſes are things that were made by the power of God;
and in the power which made them they are to be exerciſed; and ſo ſuch
Doctrine, it is not only unſound, but it is contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and
alſo the ſpirit of truth and form of ſound words; for it is old
Antichriſts Doctrine the which Sathan brought in among his Miniſters, in
this long night of Apoſtacy among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when the Churches
loſt the injoyment of the Grace, Manifeſtation, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the
Spirit of God, then they preached from a light and a ſenſe; for the
Beaſts of the Field, they have both ſenſes and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and what
preheminence hath a man above a Beaſt, if he be not in God that made him; for
all things the which a man enjoys below the Light, they are accompanied both
with vanity, and alſo vexation of Spirit: for there is no other God, Saviour,
Angel, nor Spirit, to be known in and amongſt the Sons of Men; but the Light
that ſhews unto man his thoughts: beſides, the Spirit and 

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:172147:15"/>
Power of Darkneſs, and what God made in man in the day of
his firſt Creation.</item>
                  <item>9. Alſo I diſown my ſelf to be a Member of that
Church who are gone from Chriſt, the Light of the world within them, the
power which God revealed from Heaven in this our age and generation, wherein
alone Life and Salvation, Juſtification and Condemnation, is to be known, and
are returned back again to the profeſſors Chriſt and Saviour, who dyed
without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who make it their work to declare
againſt all ſalvation, both by God and Chriſt the Light within, the
which, the profeſſors of this our age and time do.</item>
                  <item>10. I diſown all yoaks of bondage, dictates or
impoſitions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; I diſown your printing of ſeveral Books, and
impoſing them upon all Friends Meetings throughout this Nation, and
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning them to take them off; a thing that I never heard of before
amongſt any people.</item>
                  <item>11. I diſown your enjoyning one Friend to match with
another Friend, or elſe you will not admit them to come together; whenas God
hath made all Nations of one blood: and ſo remember, that <hi>Moſes</hi>
took an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> woman to wife, contrary to the command of God, and
yet God juſtified him for it; and he alſo condemned both <hi>Aaron</hi> and
<hi>Miriam</hi> for ſpeaking againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> for ſo doing.
Again, the two Sons of <hi>Naomy,</hi> they either of them took a
<hi>Moabitiſh</hi> woman to wife, and I never read they were reproved for
their ſo doing; and <hi>Ruth</hi> ſhe proved a good woman.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So Friends, I leave you to the witneſs of God that is in you;
for I little thought that ever Antichriſt would have appeared with ſuch an
old Vizard, as to raiſe up a body of Judges among us Quakers, in matters of
Religion and Conſcience, whenas we had ſuffered ſo much already by
outward Judges, becauſe we made uſe of the liberty of our Conſciences in
the things of God. Friends, a thing which was never practiced among the
primitive Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Friends, 
<list>
                     <item>1. What is the Tree of knowledge, as it is in it ſelf?
and what is the fruit it bears? and from whence doth the fruit come? and what
is that which feeds upon it, ſeeing it is deſirable to make one wiſe? and
whether the fruit be all the ſame now as it was in the beginning?</item>
                     <item>2. What was the <hi>Eden</hi> wherein the firſt man
<hi>Adam</hi> was placed? and what was the Garden wherein God walked after

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172147:15"/>
entred, when he ſpake to <hi>Adam</hi>
in the cool of the day?</item>
                     <item>3. What is the Enmity which God put between the Woman and
the Serpent, and between his Seed and her Seed? and what was or is the
Woman?</item>
                     <item>4. What was the Man that was drove out from God into the
Earth becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, ſeeing the viſible body did remain
in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Creation, after his tranſgreſſion, as viſible as it
did before?</item>
                     <item>5. What is the Image of God? or what is the Soul of Man;
for there is a diſtinction between them; for the one hath been Corrupted by
the man of ſin, but the other never ſaw Corruption, nor yet never
conſented to ſin?</item>
                     <item>6. Whether Death had any Dominion in the Tree of
Knowledge before Tranſgreſſion? or whether he took his Dominion in the
Tree of Knowledge by mans tranſgreſſing the Commands of God?</item>
                     <item>7. And what were the Eyes that were to be opened in
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> after the Devils temptation had entred them, and
they had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Command of God when they became as Gods?</item>
                     <item>8. Whether the Seed of God, that never ſinned, hath
been under the bondage of Corruption, and ſo is to be redeemed from under
Corruption, although he never ſinned, nor yet ſaw Corruption; for the Seed
is God himſelf? and whether it is not the Soul of Man that hath
tranſgreſſed, that is, to be redeemed by the Seed, and not the Seed to be
raiſed, nor yet redeemed, it being both God and Chriſt?</item>
                     <item>9. And whether the Lamb of God was ſlain before the
founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, or ſince the foundation of the World? or what was
the Lamb of God, or is the Lamb of God, which was and is ſlain, ſeeing that
Chriſt is without beginning of dayes or end of life, and he is the ſame now
that he was in the beginning, and he ever lives, and never dyeth?</item>
                     <item>10. What is the partition Wall? and what doth it
ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt? and where is the place it ſtands?</item>
                     <item>11. What is the Vail, as it is in it ſelf, which is
over the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of people who are in outward profeſſion?</item>
                     <item>12. And how ſhall a man rightly underſtand, and come
to have a certain knowledge in himſelf, manifeſted unto him, whether his
Soul feeds upon the fruit of the Tree which Knowledge bears? or whether it
feeds upon the Tree of Life? or how he ſhall really come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
whether his Soul be under the Dominion of Life? or whether Sathan be
Transformed in his Mind, Knowledge, and Underſtanding?</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:172147:16"/>
13. Whether there be a will or power,
in either Man or Woman, to believe in Chriſt the Light within, or to receive
the truth, they having loſt their firſt ſtate wherein they had power, but
now are found under the power of darkneſs by the Light, and in a ſtate of
degeneration from God?</item>
                     <item>14. When is that Reſurrection to be known that Chriſt
ſpeaks of, <hi>when they neither Marry nor are given in Marriage; but are as
the Angels of God</hi> ſeeing our viſible Bodies ſhall ever abide in the
duſt? and what is that honourable Marriage the Apoſtle ſpeaks of,
<hi>where the Bed is not defiled through Luſt?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>15. And what is the Dead that is to be raiſed in the
Sons and Daughters of Men, ſeeing the Son of God never dyeth, but the dead is
to hear his voice and live? and how ſhall the dead come to receive power to
ariſe?</item>
                     <item>16. And what are the Two witneſſes that <hi>John</hi>
ſpeaks of, which the Spirit of Life is to enter into before they can bear a
true Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for God?</item>
                     <item>17. Whether the Two <hi>Adams</hi> are not in the World,
yea, and the man of ſin too, who is the Son of Perdition? and whether
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theſe Three are not to be found in every Man and
Woman?</item>
                     <item>18. And whether the Woman that hath been in
tranſgreſſion, both in the Male and Female, ought not to be kept in
ſilence, although redeemed out of tranſgreſſion; and ſo the power of
God to ſpeak in all, and ſhe to be kept under ſubjection by the power
that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed her; and ſo all to feel the Woman kept in ſilence,
until the power of God is declaring the work of God in them, which power hath
redeemed her?</item>
                     <item>19. What was the work of the Spirit and power of God in
Chriſts Body, whilſt his Body was upon the Earth? and what is the work of
the Spirit of God in our Body whilſt we are upon the Earth? and whether the
power of Darkneſs were not in his Body, yea or nay?</item>
                     <item>20. Whether the power of Darkneſs, which is the
Original of ſin, be not in every Child when it is firſt born and come into
the viſible World, and the power of God alſo, and yet the Child not guilty
of Original ſin?</item>
                     <item>21. Whether a Man or Woman may not receive the truth, and

with the Holy Ghoſt, and yet after this, Sathan may transform himſelf in
the hearts, minds, and underſtandings of ſuch, as before had received the

            <p>MY intention in giving forth this Book is That Men ſhould learn
to honour the truth before themſelves; and alſo, for the overturning of all
ſuch who look upon themſelves to be equal in power with the truth; and for
the diſcovering both of your Doctrines and Practices which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto
the truth; and alſo for the diſcovering of the Transformations of
Antichriſt and his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Friends, You do ſhow more Homage, Reverence, and Obedience to
the form outwardly, then you do to the power of God inwardly. Now God requires,
that all men ſhould both Worſhip, Honour, and Obey the Spirit of Truth,
which he hath placed in every man, and hath given it them to profit with all:
for God hath placed mans Salvation in it. But Friends, in this you do both
Worſhip and Adore the form outwardly, beyond the power; for when you are come
together to a Meeting, then you can ſit down together in ſilence with your
Hats on; and as every ones mind is turn'd into the Spirit of Truth, and alſo
kept under ſubjection by the power of God; here every one is kept in the true
worſhipping of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be never a word declared nor ſpoken;
and yet the men may keep their Hats on if they pleaſe; but, and if any
amongſt you pretend to be moved by the Spirit to go to prayer, then both Men
and Women, they either ſtand up, or elſe they kneel down, and the Men they
all pull off their Hats, which owns your form of prayer; and herein you do both
worſhip, Reverence, and Adore the form outwardly, and the words, more then
you do the word of Life in your own particulars, wherein alone the Souls
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is placed; and thus it hath been the work of the Spirit of
Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt throughout all ages, to lead people to give more honour to the
form of founding Braſs, or tinkling Cymbals, more then to the power of God
thats in them, wherein alone mans happineſs ſtands: So Friends, I would
have you to vindicate this practice of yours if you can, otherwiſe it is high
time for the Quakers in general, to lay aſide their worſhip in reverencing
and adoring the form outwardly.</p>
            <p>But yet I would have none that read this Book to rejoyce becauſe
that I have written againſt the Quakers Miniſters; <hi>but let thoſe that
think they ſtand take heed leſt they fall.</hi> Friends, whatſoever is
written or given forth from me in this Book, which is on my part, it is written
either from a meaſure of that Spirit which hath power to open my
underſtanding, and alſo the Book of the Scriptures, or elſe it is given
forth from Sathan in me transformed into an Angel of Light; wherefore to the
Light that
<pb facs="tcp:172147:17"/>
ſhines in all your Conſciences that read this Book,
do I refer this Book for Judgement. But the Quakers from their general Meeting
ſay, That I writ from an erronious and dark Spirit: but that lies upon them
yet to prove. I have yet another Book that is written in and from the Spirit of
God; the tendency of which Book, is for the overthrowing of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts
Miniſters in this Nation, the which will abundantly tend to the Honour and
Glory of God, and alſo greatly to the outward advantage of the chief Men of
this Nation, and alſo will bring a Bleſſing both upon them and their
generation.</p>

to give it away when he hath done, he may freely do it.</p>

            <p>IN the Apoſtles dayes were Paſtors, Teachers, Elders,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in this day the Spirit it ſelf is the Paſtor, Teacher,
Elder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that if the Spirit move any to Declare or Speak,
that is the Apoſtle, Teacher, Elder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that we have not now
things in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Perſons, nor according to Perſons, but
in, or according to that power which moves in every one, which being kept too,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves out of the Apoſtacy, ſo I know no Paſtor, Teacher, Elder,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as I find moving in any, to any of theſe things, for
that is the Elder, the Apoſtle, Teacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that which
would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then this, leads into the Apoſtacy, and will ſeek to
bring dark night in again, and ſo will place the Thing to the Perſon, and
not the Perſon to the thing; and for my part, if that day ſhould prevail,
or thoſe things which Your PAPER ſeems to hold forth and inforce, I have no
other Expectation, but that the ſame exerciſe we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at your
hands, as we received at the hands of thoſe who would have held us in
Captivity in the day that the Lord firſt viſited us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:172147:18"/>
The Seed is come, and the Heir in many, who is not to
be under Tutors and Governours, which muſt not be limited, to turn unto
which, or for the good of which the Miniſtry was ſent, and in which it is
to end, it being the end of the Miniſtry unto which its Crown is to be laid
down, as to that which is worthy; and this is no dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the Miniſtry.
Now for You, becauſe You have Miniſtred, and the preſence of the Lord
hath been with You for the good of thoſe that are to be Heirs of Salvation,
to think to ſettle Your ſelf in the place of the Heir, and to inforce Your
Orders as inſtead, or over that; this is not to allow that the Seed is Come,
or that it is of age for to abide in the Houſe for ever. You muſt not
think, that becauſe the Lord hath wrought by You, that therefore he will not
work otherwiſe. This is the Error into which all have fallen that are turned
from the Truth. Therefore ſeek not to undervalue that to which You were
ſent to Miniſter; nor endeavour to keep under the Seed, for that will
<hi>Break You to pieces.</hi> The Revelation of God is to his Seed, and his
Secrets he reveals to it, for which he made the World, and for whoſe ſake
it is continued; and now the Seed is raiſed to reign over all, which will
<hi>Caſt You out,</hi> and the Parable of the Husband-man will be fulfilled
upon You. It is my Love that gives me this plainneſs of ſpeech; for I am
Jealous of every thing that may bring dark Night over again, or that may hinder
Your Work, or loſe Your Reward with the Lord; for the Son muſt abide in the
Houſe for ever, but not the Servant; therefore take heed how You ſet up
Your Laws and Conſtitutions over his Dominion, or how You take upon You to
make Laws to his Dominion, who lives for ever. Many have attempted it, and have
been <hi>Broken to pieces:</hi> and if You do the ſame, the ſame will be
Your Portion from the Hand of the Lord.</p>
